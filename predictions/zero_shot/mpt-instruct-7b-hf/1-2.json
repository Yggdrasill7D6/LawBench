        "prediction": "\nA: The correct answer is A. The answer is A because the student's view is that the direct goal of applying the law is to obtain a reasonable legal decision. The student's view is that the legal person who makes the decision should avoid being hasty and intentionally. The student's view is that the legal person who makes the decision guarantees the legitimacy and illegality of the decision by using the legal methods commonly recognized by the legal person's community, such as objective purpose interpretation, to ensure consistency between the legal decision and the substantial value or morality. The student's view is that the higher the predictability of the legal decision, the greater the effectiveness of the students to arrange and plan their lives. The higher the legitimacy of the legal decision, the greater the students' ability to arrange and plan their lives to be satisfactory.\nB: The correct answer is B. The answer is B because the student's view is that the degree of arbitrariness and intentionalness does not affect the predictability of the legal decision.\nC: The correct answer is C. The answer is C because the student's view is that if the legal decision does not have a high degree of legitimacy or legitimacy, a society cannot be a harmonious and long-lasting society, which means that the order of the society will eventually collapse.\nD: The correct answer is D.

However, there are several ways to get a car loan with bad credit. Here are some of the best options:\n1. Get a cosigner. If you have a friend or family member with good credit, you can ask them to cosign your loan. This will improve your chances of getting approved for a car loan.\n2. Shop around for the best interest rate. Compare interest rates from different lenders to find the best deal. You may be able to get a lower interest rate if you have a good credit score.\n3. Put down a large down payment. A large down payment will reduce the amount you need to borrow, which can make it easier to get approved for a car loan.\n4. Improve your credit score.
