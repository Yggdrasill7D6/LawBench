The 37-year-old driver, surnamed Wang, is accused of intentionally killing a man named Liang after he suspected his wife of being raped by Liang. The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court has accepted the case. The prosecution alleges that Wang suspected his wife of being raped by Liang and, on March 19, 2019, at around 7 p.m., he drove a car into a collision with Liang on a east-west road in a village in the city of Zhengzhou. He then chased after Liang, carrying a plastic bottle containing gasoline, and repeatedly set fire to Liang, causing him to suffer 80% burns. Wang repeatedly beat Liang with a wooden stick, hitting his head, chest, and genitals, causing him to die. The prosecution believes that Wang intentionally killed Liang to deprive him of his life, which resulted in his death, and the evidence is clear and sufficient, and he should be punished for intentional murder.

After the incident was clarified, the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration gave Liu Feng a reward of 12 million yuan for reporting the case, which was only 5% of the total amount involved in the case. However, due to the long approval process, from the time the Farine was exposed in March 2017 to the spring of 2018 when the reward was received, it was a whole year, which made Liu Feng, who had no economic income at the time, in debt. However, it is reported that the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration will optimize the work flow of the reward for reporting the case and expand the simple program and the reward ratio, shorten the reward fulfillment time limit, and protect the rights and interests of \"whistleblowers\" and encourage more people to stand out and report.#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#",

Ltd. were abnormally high for consecutive days. The CSRC immediately initiated the enforcement cooperation mechanism and arranged for the police to conduct an in-depth investigation of the relevant clues. As a result, the suspects involved in the scheme, including the actual controller of the company Lu Shan East and the middleman Wang Sijie, conspired to raise the prices of 8 stocks, making a profit of more than 4 billion yuan. The police arrested 43 main suspects in the case and seized 12 illegal trading dens. The case was filed by the people's procuratorate of Hangzhou City and the Hangzhou No. 2 Intermediate People's Court recently made a first-instance judgment. This case is a typical case of market manipulation that the CSRC and the public security organs have jointly investigated in recent years. In the future, the CSRC will continue to improve the administrative and criminal enforcement cooperation mechanism to jointly crack down on various types of securities and futures illegal crimes to maintain the stability of the market.#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n",

        "prediction": "\n\nThe Burberry Group Plc. filed a lawsuit against Baneberry, a Chinese brand, for trademark infringement. The case is being heard by the Intermediate People's Court of Suzhou, and an initial injunction was issued against the company that owns Baneberry, New Baineng Trade (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. The court ruled that Baneberry had received multiple consumer complaints regarding its products being sold on e-commerce platforms under the name Burberry, which is similar to the international brand Burberry. The court found that although Baneberry had legally obtained its name and logo in 2009 and 2011, which are similar to those of Burberry, the latter has been widely known internationally for over 100 years and has been using the knight logo and the name Burberry for decades. Although Baneberry is also registered, the court found that the defendant's actions constitute trademark infringement and are likely to constitute intentional copying and counterfeiting of the Burberry name, and thus constitute trademark infringement. The court is still deliberating the case and has not yet made a final ruling.#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n",

According to a source close to the case, the Ministry of Justice's Forensic Science Institute received a request to conduct a mental health examination on Huang Yi Chao, and the results showed that he was in the early stages of a mental disorder at the time of the crime, and that he had limited criminal responsibility.#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n",

The lawyer was found guilty of professional misconduct and given a disciplinary punishment. The National Lawyers Association held a news conference on September 26 to report on this typical case of lawyer punishment. On March 19, 2019, the Guangdong Bar Association received a complaint that lawyer Chen Yutang of the Guangdong Wanshik Law Firm had committed professional misconduct. The bar association investigated the complaint and determined that Chen Yutang had not carefully review the evidence submitted by the client, had incorrectly calculated the client's 120 work days owed, and had not used evidence such as income proof or the standard income for urban residents in the city to justify the amount of work owed, causing the client significant financial harm, which constituted professional misconduct. On June 17, 2019, the Guangdong Bar Association gave Chen Yutang a three-month suspension of membership rights as disciplinary punishment.

He spent 1200 million yuan to win a piece of land near Pingping Balance Road and completed all the procedures in one month. However, he was puzzled when he was about to transfer the property. They had already purchased the land, completed all the procedures, but why they could not transfer it? They contacted Pingping District People's Court many times, but the answer was that the person who requested to execute the contract had objections, and they also could not do anything. Mr. Zhao did not expect that it took half a year to resolve this issue. The staff of the Execution Office of Pingping District People's Court said that they did not have a specific time to transfer the property. Mr. Zhao was puzzled that although this piece of property had objections, why the Pingping District People's Court still auctioned it? Now they have issued the property certificate, but they have not been able to use it, which has caused a lot of losses. For this situation, a lawyer said that if the auction of the house has objections, it is necessary to start the lawsuit procedure first before auctioning. So buyers of auctioned houses had better do a careful survey and careful purchase to avoid such a situation.#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n",

On November 14, 2019, Liu sneaked into the Yongxing Road Tobacco and Liquor Wholesale Market in the Beigou Town of Daxing District, held a knife to the three-year-old girl, Ding, and demanded that the owner of the store hand over 2 million yuan and provide transportation tools. After the police were notified, the police arrived at the scene and dressed up as the victim's family members to negotiate with Liu.

The security guard called the police, and the man was taken back to the police station. He repeatedly said that he was not well and wanted to be sent to the hospital, but was ignored by the on-site police, and finally died the next day. Six police officers involved in the case were charged with playing a duty guarding job, and appeared in court on December 3. The defense lawyer argued that the police were not public personnel and had not received relevant professional training. The deceased Zhang was 53 years old.

According to the ban order, iPhone 6S, 7, 8 and X series models cannot be sold any more, but Apple insists that the phones are still sold normally in China and there is no problem at all, the patent related to the unnecessary functions can be solved by software updates. In order to counteract the ban order, now Apple's four major suppliers, Foxconn, Hon Hai Precision, and Samsung's mother company, Haisheng Precision, have already issued statements, accusing Qualcomm of violating anti-monopoly law and demanding Qualcomm to be sued in court. They believe that Qualcomm has illegally used some early advantages in the technology of the chip to develop a set of anti-competitive mechanisms, which obstructs other companies to compete with Qualcomm and obstructs innovation and consumers. It is said that these four major suppliers want to sue Qualcomm for compensation of 90 million US dollars.#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n",

The serious environmental pollution has been ignored for a long time. To verify the situation, on March 23, the reporter went to the pollution site reported by the public. Indeed, what the reporter saw was unimaginable. The first thing that caught the eye was a large amount of coal ash that was not treated with any environmental protection measures and was directly dumped on the ground. There was no environmental protection measures at all, so the roadsides were also polluted with coal ash. Through ground observation, it was found that the coal ash had been stored for a long time. Residents told the reporter that it was spring and the wind blew the coal ash everywhere, which seriously polluted the local farmland. During the rainy season, the coal ash flowed into the ditch with the rain, which further polluted the local water source. However, despite such a serious environmental pollution problem, for such a long time, no supervision department has intervened to investigate and handle it, allowing it to be casually polluted.

In this regard, I would like the city leaders to pay attention to this matter and let the residents of the vicinity of this place travel more safely and conveniently.#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#",
