Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi or accessing sensitive information online, as it may increase the risk of cybercrime.\n7. Consider investing in a security system, such as a home security camera, to monitor your property and deter potential thieves.\n8. If you are a victim of theft, report it to the authorities immediately and provide them with any relevant information, such as the stolen item's description and the time and location of the theft.\n\nRemember, prevention is key to avoiding theft and protecting your personal property.
